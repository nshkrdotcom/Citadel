# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Empire is a comprehensive suite of 22 interconnected Elixir packages designed to manage, orchestrate, and observe complex AI systems with maximum reliability and scalability. The system is organized into five "Ministries," each serving a specific domain of AI infrastructure management. This project aims to create detailed technical specifications for every package within the empire, ensuring coherent design, clear inter-package relationships, and idiomatic Elixir implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Principal Engineer, I want comprehensive technical specifications for all 22 AI Empire packages, so that I can understand the complete architecture and implementation approach for each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating specifications THEN the system SHALL provide detailed specs for all 22 packages across 5 ministries
2. WHEN documenting each package THEN the system SHALL include mandate, core responsibilities, key dependencies, and API sketches
3. WHEN defining package relationships THEN the system SHALL clearly identify internal dependencies between empire packages
4. WHEN creating API sketches THEN the system SHALL use idiomatic Elixir code with proper module structure and function signatures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a BEAM Architect, I want each ministry's packages to have coherent design patterns and clear separation of concerns, so that the overall system maintains architectural integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing packages by ministry THEN the system SHALL ensure each ministry has a distinct domain focus
2. **Guiding Principle:** The design should strive for clear separation of concerns, ensuring that responsibilities for a given domain are consolidated within appropriate packages to minimize redundancy while allowing for necessary collaboration
3. **Guiding Principle:** Dependencies should form a directed acyclic graph that reflects natural architectural layers, favoring composition over tight coupling
4. WHEN designing APIs THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns within each ministry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer implementing these packages, I want specific and actionable core responsibilities for each package, so that I understand exactly what problems each component solves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing core responsibilities THEN the system SHALL provide 3-5 specific, actionable functions per package
2. WHEN describing functionality THEN the system SHALL use concrete examples rather than generic descriptions
3. WHEN defining responsibilities THEN the system SHALL focus on specific problems solved rather than abstract concepts
4. WHEN documenting features THEN the system SHALL indicate the technical approach or methodology used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want clear dependency mappings for each package, so that I can understand the integration requirements and deployment order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing internal dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify all AI Empire packages that each component depends on
2. WHEN specifying external dependencies THEN the system SHALL list key Elixir libraries and external tools required
3. WHEN documenting dependencies THEN the system SHALL distinguish between runtime and compile-time dependencies
4. **Guiding Principle:** The final dependency map should be validated to ensure it forms a clean, hierarchical structure that supports logical deployment ordering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Elixir developer, I want practical API sketches for each package, so that I can understand the public interface and integration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing API sketches THEN the system SHALL include main public modules with primary function signatures
2. WHEN writing code examples THEN the system SHALL use proper Elixir syntax and conventions
3. WHEN defining function signatures THEN the system SHALL include @spec annotations where beneficial
4. WHEN showing module structure THEN the system SHALL reflect the core responsibilities in the API design
5. WHEN creating sketches THEN the system SHALL ensure APIs are production-ready and idiomatic

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want the specifications organized by ministry with clear categorization, so that I can understand the scope and complexity of each domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing specifications THEN the system SHALL group packages by their respective ministries
2. WHEN presenting each ministry THEN the system SHALL include all packages listed in that domain
3. WHEN structuring output THEN the system SHALL follow the specified markdown format consistently
4. WHEN documenting ministries THEN the system SHALL maintain the established naming and organizational structure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an Architect, I want the specification to include design rationale for key architectural decisions, so that I can understand the trade-offs and reasoning behind complex design choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying complex packages THEN the system SHALL include design rationale explaining architectural choices
2. WHEN describing inter-package relationships THEN the system SHALL explain why certain dependency patterns were chosen
3. WHEN defining API boundaries THEN the system SHALL justify the interface design decisions
4. WHEN presenting alternative approaches THEN the system SHALL briefly explain why the chosen approach was preferred

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Principal Engineer, I want the architecture designed for extensibility, performance, and maintainability, so that the empire can evolve and handle production workloads effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Guiding Principle:** Communication patterns should favor asynchronous messaging and supervision trees to support BEAM scalability characteristics
2. **Guiding Principle:** Dependencies should prefer abstractions over concrete implementations where it improves extensibility and testability
3. WHEN designing data flow patterns THEN the system SHALL consider fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN specifying performance-critical components THEN the system SHALL indicate expected performance characteristics and scaling considerations
